# Example Configuration Files

The configuration file examples provided are examples of the format of configuraiton and input files RED-I needs to run.  These examples are not yet complete.  A more complete RED-I Configuration will be forthcoming.  Until that time, please contact the authors for assistance in creating a valid configuration.  

## Getting REDCap

Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a software package written and distributed by Vanderbilt University.  If you do not already have a access to a REDCap system see http://project-redcap.org/ for details on how to become a consortium partner.  

Your institution may already provide you with access to REDCap.  If so you can use that access to create a test project.  With that, some assistance from your technical staff, and a few edits of the example files, you can test REDI.

REDI also includes the ability to create a REDCap server inside a virtual machine running on your own computer.  For more details on that option see README-vm.md
