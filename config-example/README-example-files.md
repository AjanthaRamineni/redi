# Example Configuration Files

The configuration file examples provided here will allow you to test RED-I to push data into a sample REDCap project.  To use these files you will need access to a running REDCap server with the appropriate example project, and an API Token for that project that allows you to write to the project.  


## Getting REDCap

Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a software package written and distributed by Vanderbilt University.  If you do not already have a access to a REDCap system see http://project-redcap.org/ for details on how to become a consortium partner.  

Your institution may already provide you with access to REDCap.  If so you can use that access to create a test project.  With that, some assistance from your technical staff, and a few edits of the example files, you can test REDI.

REDI also includes the ability to create a REDCap server inside a virtual machine running on your own computer.  For more details on that option see README-vm.md


## Getting the Right REDCap Project to use these files

This example configuration is based on the one of the default REDCap example projects.  This project is identified as "Longitudinal Database (1 arm)" in the REDCap template library.  In fresh REDCap installations like you will find in the test virtual machine, the project named "Example Database (Longitudinal)" has a;ready been created for you using this template.
