# RED-I Authors

The RED-I Project would not be possible without the generous contributions of 
our authors and contributors.

David R Nelson and his HCV Target project and the University of Florida Clinical Translational Science Institute for providing the seed funding that launched the RED-I Project.

Christopher P. Barnes (senrabc@gmail.com) provided the original concept and proposal for a generic, standards-based bridge between the electronic medical record and REDCap systems.  

Many thanks to David Nelson, Mike Freid, Joy Peter, Ken Berguist, and Monika Vainorius of the HCV Target Study Team and all of the HCV Target study sites for being the pilot project for RED-I.  You all helped make it great.  

Philip Chase (philipbchase@gmail.com), Nicholas Rejack (nrejack@ufl.edu), and Chris Barnes provided direction to the development effort. 

Radha Kandula, Mohan Das Katragadda, Yang Li, Nicholas Rejack, and Philip Chase provided code to make this project awesome.  We are nothing without our developers.
